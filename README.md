This is part of the hyperscanning project that explores how Virtual Reality(VR) can be used to help people understand each other better in face-to-face and remote collaboration, with the ultimate goal of designing an empathic computing interface.  Simultaneous and classification of data from multiple physiological sensors will be carried out to study inter-brain synchrony cognitive load and emotional responses of two or more collaborators in real and virtual environments.


This section explains the implementation of Trigger used to mark the start and end of sessions in BCI designer. This simple TCP/IP client sends markers to the OpenBCI server. The Completed java based app can be found here - https://github.com/prasanthsasikumar/OpenBCITrigger
